						It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives.
						But what makes us human is that we fight for others.
						But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...?
						That's the true measure of what human life is worth.
						We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question.
						Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed...
						We always return...
						Time and time again.<br>

					<p>
						Phoenix Wright is a veteran defense attorney in the Ace Attorney game series who heads the Wright Anything Agency.<br>
						His hair is unnaturally spiky, yet he claims it's all natural.<br>
						He has no idea what he is doing 99% of the time in court.
						He carved out a name for himself by grasping at straws, bluffing through thick and thin, and turning hopeless cases around.
						Because he is a reckless idiot who believes in his client's innocence.
						He was a genius and extremely clever in the Apollo Justice game, though.
						But otherwise, he is a foolishly foolish fool who does foolishly foolish foolery in a foolishly foolish manner.<br>
						He should also be dead. He almost died like 4 times, and all of those situations are supposed to be fatal in real life, plus a ton of other situations.<br>
						Getting a face full of toupee,
						eating a metal necklace laced with poison,
						getting punched in the face with a fist covered in jewelery,
						getting swarmed and almost "erased" by a mafia group,
						getting tasered with a 600,000 volt stun gun,
						getting bashed in the head with a fire extinguisher resulting in short-term amnesia,
						getting whipped a bunch of times (and one time he got whipped so much he fell unconcious),
						getting harassed by a monkey,
						getting pelted by bird seeds,
						falling off a rickety, <i>burning</i> bridge and plunging into freezing cold river rapids known for washing their victims away,
						getting bashed around from rock to rock before eventually washing up on shore (and yet he was only hospitalized for 2 days and caught a cold),
						and getting hit by a car resulting in him flying 30 feet high into the air, only stopping until he smashed into a telephone pole on his head (yet walking off with just a sprained ankle).
